<b>Project Title:</b> Agricultural-CO2-Emissions Data Analysis

<b>Description:</b> 
The dataset combines information from the FAO and IPCC to analyze the impact of the agri-food sector on climate change. It reveals that agriculture is a major contributor to global CO2 emissions. By examining the relationship between emissions, climate change, and geography, the dataset offers insights into sustainable agricultural practices. Machine learning techniques, demonstrated through temperature prediction, highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to mitigate climate change. This comprehensive dataset and its analysis provide valuable information for understanding and addressing the environmental impact of agriculture.
